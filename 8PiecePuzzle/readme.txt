Breadth-First Search (MAIN) and Depth-First search (Works but large heap space needed).

Summary: The 4x4 is very much more complicated than the 3x3 test cases. Many more nodes were searched and were placed in the explored queue when the board size goes up.

Instructions: 
BFS command line:   java boardBFS testFile.txt
DFS command line:   java boardDFS testFile.txt

Warnings: 
- DFS is very slow on 3x3...
- BFS works as it should, not fully optimized.
