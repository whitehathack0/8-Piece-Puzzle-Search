My Name: Aditya Kumar

- Breadth-First Search (MAIN) and Depth-First search

Heuristic used for A*: I used Manhattan distance for my heuristic.

Summary: The 4x4 is very much more complicated than the 3x3 test cases. Many more nodes were searched and were placed in the explored queue when the board size goes up.

Instructions: 
BFS command line:   java boardBFS testFile.txt
DFS command line:   java boardDFS testFile.txt
AStar command line: java boardAStar testFile.txt

Warnings: 
- A* is not working, I have my heuristic implemented.
- DFS is very slow on 3x3...
- BFS works as it should, not fully optimized.
